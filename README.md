## ðŸ“² *How LifeLearn Works*

When users open the app:

   * Users can Sign Up or Log In
   * Credentials are stored locally (demo mode â€” no backend)

2. *Persistent User Sessions*

   * Authentication status is checked using AsyncStorage

3. *Gamified Dashboard*

   * Displays user's name, learning streaks, recent game scores
   * Offers a motivational, visual overview of progress

4. *Interactive Games & Activities*

   * Budget Management Game
   * Situation-Based Decision Making
   * Memory Development Exercises
   * Scores are tracked locally, reinforcing learning with measurable feedback
